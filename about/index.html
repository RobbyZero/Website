        <h2>How I started</h2>
        <p>I'm RobbyZero and when I was young I started coding. The end result was something like <a href="https://arcade.makecode.com/84307-36629-29645-09679">this</a>. Eventually I got better and made stuff like <a href="https://arcade.makecode.com/S52779-67971-26119-92030">this</a>. Then I got a rush of energy and suddenly just woke up with what I call decent coding skills. I built on that evenually making even more decent stuff. Until recently when I built on that and got SOMEWHAT GOOD SKILLS! So that's where I'm at now. Coding this website with somewhat good skills and limited knowlege of anything outside of HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>Whatever I make it into. I want this website to be a fun place to show off projects and my somewhat good coding skill.</p>
